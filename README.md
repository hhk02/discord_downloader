# discord_upgrader
This simple script can upgrade Discord (if you downloaded Discord with tar.gz )

# This it's a simple script and this is the first version so probably have issues.

If you Discord it's installed in /usr/share/discord probably works :D

I recommend remove previous Discord Installation for a good result.
